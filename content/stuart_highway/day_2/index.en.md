Previous: [Darwin &#8211; Tasting Crocodile](https://jan-steinke.de/wordpress/darwin-tasting-crocodile/)

The first night away from Adelaide. We all woke up revitalized and ready to explore. This day was without any special events. We went to the wave pool in Darwin because swimming in the ocean is too dangerous (Sharks, Crocodiles etc.) and hung out in the hostel's pool. In the evening we went to a beach market a few minutes outside of Darwin. It was a nice spot to get some nice souvenirs (I didn't buy anything). Jamie, our Newcastle boy, bought a new hat that was made from old Road Train canvas.<figure id="attachment_954" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

You will see him wearing this in future pictures. the Mindil Beach market was a great opportunity to hang out that night. After it closed at around 9pm, Jamie, Orion and I went to the beach while the girls went back to the hostel. The beach was covered with hermit crabs and it looked like the beach was running away from us as we walked on the beach towards city center. Back in the Hostel we killed some time by taking pictures in the pool.
