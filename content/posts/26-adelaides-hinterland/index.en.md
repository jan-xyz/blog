It's two weeks since I arrived in Adelaide and a lot of stuff has happened. The most memorable of all is probably last weekend's trip into the Adelaide Hills. A little teaser: I saw wild kangaroos.

I got to say that I am super lucky with my housemate. I already mentioned that Richard is a local from Adelaide and traveled arround the world. He knows many people in and around Adelaide as well as stuff about other countries and the life in Germany. He is just nice to have around and talk to.

Last weekend he took me to a friend's birthday in the hills surrounding Adelaid. I was happy from the beginning to see some more from the area but I never thought that it will be so memorable. We took of on early Saturday afternoon and arrived around 4 at the party. The closer we got to the mountains the greener it got. The hills were populated with some smaller and bigger eucalyptus forests.

It was really nice and refreshing to get out of town and see the wonderful nature. Fortunately, it is winter right now which means a lot of rain and green grass and trees. The birthday itself was very pleasant and I met a lot of Richard's oldest friends that were all nice and extremely welcoming.

The next morning was relaxed because most guests left already. We had breakfast and enjoyed a slow Sunday morning. The original plan was to take a walk in the hills as Tony, the birthday boy, had a lot of land that he used for his forestry. However, the bad weather kept us inside and we ultimately took the car to another forest because Richard and a friend wanted to get fresh eucalyptus wood. As they started to prepare the tree I actually had my first encounter with one of Australia's most iconic animals. I found a group of kangaroos and took some pictures.

Afterwards we made our way home. In the car I had to fight against my tiredness. As soon as we arrived I went to sleep and slept from 9pm to 9am.
