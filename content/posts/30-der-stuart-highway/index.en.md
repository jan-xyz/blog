It was a rainy Saturday morning in Adelaide. Two men were waiting in a car in
the CBD of Adelaide outside the University Accommodation on Grote Street. I was
one of them, the other one was my housemate, Richard. We were waiting for 
Maddy, a girl from Newcastle, UK. My housemate did us a favor and gave us a 
lift to the airport on that sad-looking Saturday. The airport was the meeting
point on that Saturday for a group of 5 people (Lin, Maddy, Orion, Jamie and
I). We had one goal that brought us together: see as much of Australia as we
can in the short 2 weeks that we had for our mid-semester break. We were all
grateful for that break from the dull work at Uni and an opportunity to break
free from every-day life. Where were we heading? Our Aim that Saturday morning
was Darwin, NT. A city on the northern tip of Australia, the capital of
Northern Territory. The reason we were heading that way was our joined goal:
start in the north, get to the south - by land. In the upcoming post I will
describe and relive the 2 weeks that I spent seeing some of the most remarkable
sights I have ever seen. It was filled with joy, anger, fatigue, activity,
boredom and excitement. I learned a lot for the future and had enlightening
discussions with people I met.
