title: The fast way to move in.

Wow. I moved faster into a new house than I expected and even for a relatively reasonable price (Price are much more variable than in Maastricht ranging from 300â‚¬ to unlimited, whereas prices in the upper price segment are much more frequent)

**The House**

It was build in the late 19th century and is a heritage of the urban landscape. It sits in a smaller street in the south-east of the city approximately 1.5km from the campus. There are shops and restaurants right around the corner and free parking in front of the door. Although I do not own a car (yet?!) I got fancy of the idea to have the opportunity of free parking in front of the house. My room is relatively small and around 2m x 3m. I got a window towards south, a huge loft bed, a desk and a couch.The kitchen, living room and dining room are on the ground floor while bath and bed rooms are upstairs.

**The Room Mates**

I got two new room mates in my new house. Richard, an artist and currently teacher, is the oldest. He used to live in Hamburg for a couple of years and does speak a little German as well. Eiligh (pron. Eyli), interrupted her study and is currently bar manager, is about my age and comes originally from a Scotish/Swedish family. Both of them are nice and welcoming people and we used last night to socialise a bit and talk about Australia.
