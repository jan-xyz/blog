title: A new endeavour &#8211; Adelaide, Australia

I already told some of you that I will spend my upcoming semester in Asutralia.
However, until now it all was kind of unclear and not yet completely sure but
all that changed today with my visa. I got granted a 6 month student visa and
can stay for the entirety of my semester abroad. I came a long way and it
included several steps to finally be sure that I will leave Europe. I had to

  * Hand in an approval sheet for my preferred courses.
  * Transmit my personal details to the University in Australia
  * Book the flight
  * Get an Australian health insurrance
  * Apply for a student visa
  * Get a medical check

The list still continues and only includes the major steps but now I am ready
to leave and nothing can hold me from doing so. I will leave Europe on the 7th
of July and will fly directly to Adelaide where I will spend most of my time.
I am not yet entirely sure what to do from the moment of my arrival but I will
probably try to find a hostel to use as my headquarter for the first days,
check out some houses for permanent residence and take a look at the
University. I am sure it all will sort itself out. Next up is my first report
from Australia.

Talk to you soon, mate.
