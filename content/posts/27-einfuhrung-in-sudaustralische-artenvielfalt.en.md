The introductory period at the Uni is over. That means I spent the last week going to semi-important lectures and meeting the other international students.

Last Friday marked the final day and the University organized a day-trip. For only $10 we got the opportunity to go to a wildlife park that is approx. 70km south in the hills. The park was a perfect opportunity to get a crash course in local fauna of Sotuh Australia. Next to the Kangaroos and Koalas the park is housing Emus, Wombats, local birds and reptiles. The most memorable feature of the park is the huge outdoor pen for the Kangaroos, who spent their time chilling in the sun. Koala petting was also part of the activity. However, those little marsupials felt a little overwhelmed by the 200 students.

After the wildlife park we went to a close town at the sea called Victor Harbour. It is historically important as well as candy for every photographer. In the 19th century British and French explorers met to finish the world map by exchanging their maps of Australia. Another nice thing about Victor Harbour is the view from Granite Island towards south. The next landmass in that direction happens to be the most southern point: Antarctica.
