24 hours have passed since I put feet on Australian ground. The country of
kangaroos and koalas. I arrived yesterday at around 8pm and in this short post
I will describe what I did and what happened.

## Flight to Dubai
Actually I will start a bit earlier than 24h ago. To be precise Sunday around
11pm (Central European Time). It was the time my family and me drove to Hamburg
to catch my flight. We were lucky enough to not end up in a traffic jam but
circumvent it. A friend of mine was not so lucky and got stuck in there for an
extra 2hours. The arrival at the airport was nothing special. A last snack with
the family, check-in and boarding. As we arrived in Dubai we were taken to the
terminal by a bus in which I met the friend I mentioned earlier. Although we
were both heading to Australia she was about to go to Perth whereas I was going
further east to Adelaide. I had two hours to kill but we talked a lot and
checked out the airport before I had to board the next plane which made the
wait short enough to bear. However, my friend had to wait an extra hour.

## Flight to Adelaide
The second flight was as boring as the first but 3 times longer and I spent it
the most time asleep. However, during take-off I was able to shoot some nice
picture of Dubai and the coast of Australia. In total I spent almost 21 hours
traveling and flew 15.000km.

## After the landing
As I arrived in Adelaide I took the next taxi going to the city centre and
asked for a hostel. He dropped me of at one that turned out to be quite cheap
but also low standard and not the nicest place to be. However, looking back it
was a good decision. It saved me money and I only need it as a base station to
check out the city and find a room to stay. I am now in a 10-bed room with a
few other guys. It is smelly and dirty but I will survive! Today I spend my
time going to the University, looking for a room and walking around town. I
have to say that Adelaide is a nice place to be. It is quite and a bit laid
back for a city of that size but it is big enough to explore it. My evening was
occupied by my quest for a room and I checked out 2 places that I both like.
Which one I'll end up with is a story of the future.
