Previous:  [Kangaroo Island – Kangaroo, Koala, Lighthouse, Seal & Rocks](https://jan-steinke.de/wordpress/en/kangaroo-island-kangaroo-koala-lighthouse-seal-rocks/)

The last day. A two week trip in the car is over. There wasn&#8217;t much to do anymore, we cleaned up everything and took the van back to the rental.

I hope you all enjoyed the pictures and stories I told. I am thankful for the people I met and travelled with. We had our differences and that was unfortunate but nevertheless it was a great and fun trip with you. Thank you for being awesome!
