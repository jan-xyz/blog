After a couple of hours flight, covering a distance that is approximately the distance from Copenhagen to Sevilla, we arrived in Darwin. It was a sunny and warm day, Orion, our Frenchmen in the team immediately started complaining about the heat as we all were not prepared for the weather change. A few hours earlier we were freezing in Adelaide&#8217;s spring rain. Still at the airport we met a group of other exchange students that were spending their time in Darwin for the Mid-semester break. We had chat with them and shared the shuttle bus to the city center to get to our hostel (Dingo Moon Lodge).<figure id="attachment_940" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

  When we arrived at the hostel the girls went to do some basic grocery shopping to make lunch for tomorrow (Sunday) while we took a bath in the hostel&#8217;s pool. As it got darker we got ready to get out in the city. Orion was eager to taste some crocodile meat, a specialty in Darwin and other cities that are close to crocodile areas. We found a restaurant directly at the sea front that offered crocodile so we sat down and enjoyed the finale of our first day.
