The last day. A two week trip in the car is over. There wasn't much to do
anymore, we cleaned up everything and took the van back to the rental.

I hope you all enjoyed the pictures and stories I told. I am thankful for the
people I met and travelled with. We had our differences and that was
unfortunate but nevertheless it was a great and fun trip with you. Thank you
for being awesome!
