Dear Visitor,

I started this blog in 2010 when it first meant for me to leave Europe for a longer period of time. To keep my parents, friends and acquaintances up to date with my doings I decided to start writing a blog. Unfortunately, I only wrote for a German speaking community back than so all older posts are only available in German. I will do my best to update them for you to enjoy!

In 2010 I wrote about my voluntary year(FSJ; German: Freiwilliges Soziales Jahr) on the Philippines. I stayed in a little town called Lucena approx. 100km south of Manila. I had a lot to write about and got loads of positive feedback about my stories which made me keep my blog over the years.

After the Philippines I went to Maastricht in the Netherlands to continue my academic career. There were many little things that I summarized on the blog.

The next endeavor took me to Adelaide, Australia, for my exchange semester. What will happen in the future is not foreseeable but I will definitely continue writing about it!

If you have any questions, complains or advises feel free to contact me. I am happy to answer your questions and look forward to helping you.

yours, Jan
